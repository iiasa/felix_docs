The Full of Economic-Environment Linkages and Integration dX/dt (FeliX) is a global system dynamics model of climate, economy, environment and society interactions, developed at International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis ([IIASA](https://iiasa.ac.at/models-tools-data/felix)), first within the [GEO-BENE](https://geo-bene.project-archive.iiasa.ac.at/) project. 

This site is the online documentation for the FeliX model. Here, we provide overview of the underlying modeling methodology, and information to the FeliX resources and publications. The online documation is also supporting the methodology paper pulished as [Ye et al. *Environmental Modelling & Software* (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsoft.2024.106121).
